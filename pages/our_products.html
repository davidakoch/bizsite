It would be an electric car, powered by batteries that are charged by solar-panels on the roof of the vehicle, FOX News reports. Golfers sitting in either the passenger seat or the driver's seat can maneuver it using a joystick in the middle instead of a steering wheel.

Throughout the week, the golf club has reportedly been removing trees to make room and designating lakes on the course that the vehicles - which reportedly cost $58,000 a piece - are allowed to fly over.
