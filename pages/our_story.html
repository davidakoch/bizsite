<h1>Who We Are</h1>

	<div class="smails">  Judge Elihu Smails, the country club's stodgy co-founder and director of the Caddy Scholarship program, by caddying for him. Meanwhile, Bushwood's head greenskeeper Sandy McFiddish is pressured by Smails to deal with a potentially disastrous gopher infestation, and he entrusts his dubiously qualified assistant Carl Spackler with the task.

	When Smails is heckled by the opinionated nouveau riche Al Czervik at tee off, causing a poor drive, he throws a putter and accidentally injures a member of the club. Danny seizes the opportunity and takes responsibility for the incident, gaining Smails' trust. Smails encourages him to apply for the Caddy Scholarship. </div>

	<p><img src="TyWebb.jpg" class="profilePic" alt="See The Ball" width="300">   That evening, while practicing for the round against Smails, Ty hits an errant shot into Carl's home (a ramshackle toolshed on the course). This scene reveals Carl's career plan to become head greenskeeper and their shared disdain for Smails. As evidence of his commitment to his career path, Carl unveils a special hybrid grass (containing cannabis) that he created. Carl and Ty share a bottle of cheap wine and an enormous spliff made up from some of Carl's invention. Ty eventually plays a shot off of a patch of Carl's grass and back onto the golf course.
