	 Judge Elihu Smails, the company's stodgy Co-founder and Director of our Caddy Scholarship Program is often heckled by the opinionated nouveau riche Al Czervik (who accidentally sank Smails' small sloop during the christening ceremony). He is also know for his poetry. <br>	   "It's easy to grin<br>
		when your ship comes in<br>
		and you've got the stock market beat.<br>
		But the man worthwhile<br>
		is the man who can smile<br>
		when his shorts are too tight in the seat".

		 A suave, friendly, cheeky chap who is a talented golfer and the son of one of the Company's co-founders.  Famous for one of the most quoted pieces of advice ever uttered: "There's a force in the universe that makes things happen; all you have to do is get in touch with it. Stop thinking... let things happen... and be... the ball."
